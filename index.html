                        My experience while doing these courses where outstanding in MSIT program where unlike other
                        courses which are much into therory this course has lot of practicals and end project for each
                        course which made us to learn the corporate way of doing things and exposure in lot more
                        areas. As a result we not only enjoyed the subject but also gained practical Expereience by
                        doing real world projects.
